// Bounds on the outbound queue.
//
// The queue exists so that no request-handling goroutine ever waits on the
// socket: a CHANGE_NOTIFY completion or a blocking-lock completion that lands
// while the peer has stopped reading used to hold the connection's write mutex
// for a whole writeTimeout (two minutes), during which the dispatch loop could
// not answer anything at all. Handing frames to a single writer goroutine moves
// that wait off every producer.
//
// It is bounded both ways, because either bound alone is useless:
//   - by frame count, at twice the credit window, so a client that honours the
//     credits the server grants it can never overflow the queue even when every
//     one of its requests is an async one that draws both an interim
//     STATUS_PENDING and a completion;
//   - by bytes, because a single READ response can be MaxIOSize, and a
//     count-only bound would let a peer that has stopped reading park gigabytes
//     of response buffers in memory.
//
// Crossing either bound means the peer is not draining its socket, and the
// connection is dropped rather than the queue grown.
